## 🪖⏱ Final Project for Senior Course 🎓🏁

A senior course designed to be a year long that simulated a real-world need for a software application for a client. 
In our artificial business, the U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command department, in which were actual alumni students that actually 
work for the U.S. Army since the university is located to an actual army fort, fabricated and constructed a project idea for our course to build & code over
the year. The first semster dealt with documenting specifications and capturing requirements and the second semester dealt with implementing and designing the 
software application through various software development life cycles and techniques.

Our clinet wanted a software desktop application that ran within a linux operating system that inspected and analyzed network protocols and executable files
within system computer networks. The program required to be able to conduct static and dynamic analysis on binary files. The program integrates the ***Radare2***
software api extraction tool and was to support other different software api plugins. The application also supports a database by intergrating the open-source database software, ***MongoDB***.
